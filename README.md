# Software Defined Datacenter:

# Problem statement:
### Overview: 
Deploying a Software defined network(SDN) on a physical hardware consisting raspberry pi. Performing network slicing and further installing firewall as a service on the sliced network.


### Description:
*The deployed single physical network which contains two types of traffic : Type-1 (Faculty) and Type-2 (students). The Type-1 traffic gets higher bandwidth and lower delays and goes through relaxed firewall rules while Type-2 gets smaller bandwidth per user and best effort delays and restricted rules through firewall.* 

### Tasks:
1. Deploy SDN network on hardware using 6 host(3 raspberry pi and 3 ubuntu complaint system), neatgear L2 switch and SDN software components. This is [task 1](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Project/blob/master/tasks/task1/NetworkSetup.md). 
2. Performing network slicing using OpenVirtex and mininet. This is [task 2](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Project/blob/master/tasks/task2/NetworkSlicing.md).
3. Deploying SDN virtual network according to the description provided above.
4. Installing various network functions such as Firewall as a Service(FWaaS) on the above sliced network inside mininet. This is [task 3](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Datacenter/tree/master/tasks/task3).
 
### Project Documentation:

1. [Network topology](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Project/blob/master/tasks/task1/Topology.md) deployed using SDN on physical hardware.
2. Procedure followed for various tasks:</br >
  a. For [task 1](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Project/blob/master/tasks/task1/NetworkSetup.md). </br >
  b. For [task 2](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Project/blob/master/tasks/task2/NetworkSlicing.md). </br >
  c. For [task 3](https://github.com/shreyakupadhyay/SDN-Datacenter/tree/master/tasks/task3). </br >
